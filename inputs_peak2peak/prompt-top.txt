I had spring storm damage to my roof. Peak 2 Peak was very professional, easy to deal with and completed my job in a timely manner. I also had them check another home for storm damage and they were honest and let us know that roof was good to go. Trustworthy contractors are so important! Thank you Peak 2 Peak!

Shanin does great work and knows how to work with insurance companies incredibly well! He told us what they would accept, and what they probably wouldn't. He was 100% correct. Great communication and easy to work with.

Shanin McCoy is a quality Roofer! Not just a person passing through St. Joseph. He has been around the St. Joseph area his whole life and working with insurance companies to make sure what is covered is taken care of in a timely matter.
