Create a detailed content outline for a Press Release about {keyword}.

Key Information to Consider:
1. Title-Focused Terms: {titleTermsList}
2. Core Content Terms: {basicTermsList}
3. Questions from {questions}.
4. Key Entities and their Metrics: {entitiesList}

The outline should:
- Only ever contain 1 level one heading. The level 1 heading should always be the title of the article.
- Use level 2 headings for the remaining items in the outline.
- Contain enough headings to use all the {titleTermsList}.
- Include at least 2 level 2 headings as CTAs (e.g., 'Get Connected with the Living Hope Church') placed near the middle and end of the outline.
- Use the provided {questions} to create a FAQ section, but do not include 'FAQ' in the heading text. Each question should be a level 2 heading.
- Be formatted using markdown with # for the title, and ## for level 2.
- Never contain bold items, strong items, lists, or other formatting.
- Prioritize covering {entitiesList} with higher importance and relevance scores.
- Try to reflect these {entitiesList} in section topics if relevant
- Contain headings that strengthen topic.
- End with a conclusion about the {keyword}.
