## Our Driveway Services: Stone, Gravel, Asphalt and Concrete Installation
We install and repair <strong>gravel driveways</strong>, crushed stone driveways, asphalt paving, and concrete driveways.  
Services include excavation, base installation, compaction, paving, edging, and storm water management solutions.  
Projects can be residential driveways, parking lots, or municipal sidewalk and curb replacements.

## Gravel Driveway Installation Process by Eger Excavating & Concrete LLC
We start with a site visit and soil evaluation to plan proper drainage and thickness.  
Next, we excavate to depth, install geotextile fabric when needed, and place compacted base stone.  
Finally, we add a finish layer of crushed stone and install edge restraints for long-term stability.

## Gravel Driveway Services: Materials, Compaction and Longevity
We use quality aggregates like #2 crushed stone for base and #57 or #8 for surface finish.  
Proper compaction and layering are essential to prevent ruts and maintain a smooth driving surface.  
With routine maintenance, a well-built gravel driveway can last <strong>10 to 30 years</strong> depending on use.

## Stone Driveway Services: Crushed Stone Selection and Aesthetics
Crushed stone comes in several sizes and colors to match your landscape and style preferences.  
We can recommend blends that pack well and produce an attractive texture for your driveway surface.  
Adding a top binder or larger shoulder stones improves appearance and reduces migration of material.

## Asphalt Concrete Solutions: Paving, Resurfacing and Durability
Asphalt is an excellent choice for smooth driving surfaces and heavier vehicle traffic.  
We provide paving, resurfacing, and complete replacements for worn asphalt driveways and lots.  
Proper base preparation and drainage design are crucial for asphalt longevity and crack prevention.

## Concrete Driveways: Design Options, Strength and Finishes
Concrete offers low maintenance with many finish and color options for curb appeal.  
We pour driveways with proper reinforcement, expansion joints, and controlled slopes for drainage.  
Stamped concrete and broom finishes provide style while maintaining functionality and durability.

## Driveway Design and Paving: Balancing Beauty and Function
Good design balances accessibility, slope, drainage, and aesthetics for a functional driveway that looks great.  
We plan widths, turns, and transitions to meet daily use and local code requirements.  
Landscape integration and edge treatments enhance curb appeal and reduce long-term maintenance.

## Excavation and Site Preparation: Excavation, Grading and Soil Evaluation
We begin with precise excavation to reach the required depth for base and finish materials.  
Grading creates the correct slope for water runoff and prevents ponding near foundations.  
Soil tests determine whether subgrade stabilization or geotextile fabric is necessary for lasting results.

## Grading, Leveling and Compaction Standards for Durable Driveways
A consistent base grade and <strong>proper compaction</strong> prevent settlement and potholes in the future.  
We compact in lifts using appropriate equipment to meet industry compaction standards.  
For gravel driveways, typical compacted base depth ranges from four to six inches, depending on soil and loads.

## Drainage Design to Prevent Ruts, Potholes and Erosion
Good drainage is the single most important factor for long-lasting driveways and minimal repairs.  
We design swales, culverts, French drains, and headwalls to control runoff and prevent erosion.  
Proper drainage reduces maintenance and protects nearby landscaping and structures.

## Curbing and Edge Restraints: Keeping Gravel and Stone in Place
Edge restraints like concrete curbs, timber, or pavers keep gravel from spreading into the yard.  
They improve appearance, reduce migration, and extend the life of your stone driveway.  
We recommend edge restraints on any driveway with regular vehicle traffic or sloped terrain.

## Residential Driveway Installation: What Homeowners Should Expect
Homeowners can expect a clear timeline, permit coordination when needed, and staged work for minimal disruption.  
Typical residential projects include excavation, base placement, compaction, surfacing, and final grading.  
We keep properties tidy and communicate project milestones and any unexpected findings during work.

## Installing Driveways: Timeline, Equipment and Project Stages
Small gravel driveway installs often take one to three days, depending on site conditions and weather.  
Large projects or concrete pours may require multiple days for excavation, curing, and final touches.  
We use excavators, compactors, skid steers, and paving machines to ensure efficient, professional results.

## Driveway Installation Process: From Excavation to Final Pave
1. Site inspection and layout to confirm grades, drainage, and edge details.  
2. Excavation and subgrade preparation to the engineered depth for base materials.  
3. Base stone placement and compaction followed by finish layer and edge installation.

## Comparing Types of Driveways: Gravel, Concrete, Asphalt and Pavers
Gravel is cost-effective, permeable, and easy to repair but needs periodic upkeep.  
Asphalt provides smooth driving surfaces and moderate cost with periodic resurfacing requirements.  
Concrete lasts long, offers many finishes, and costs more up front than gravel in most cases.

## Cost Considerations and Budgeting for Driveway Projects
Costs depend on material choice, driveway size, site access, grading needs, and drainage work.  
Gravel driveway costs typically range from roughly $1.25 to $3.50 per square foot installed.  
Concrete and asphalt usually cost more up front, but offer different maintenance and lifespan profiles.

## Maintenance and Repair: Pothole Fixes, Resurfacing and Routine Care
For potholes, remove loose material, level the area, add fresh stone, then compact firmly.  
Routine maintenance includes adding new surface stone, grading, and maintaining drains in spring and fall.  
Sealing asphalt and cleaning concrete joints extend pavement life and reduce costly repairs.

## Durability Factors: Weather, Soil, Load and Material Choices
Freeze-thaw cycles, poor drainage, and heavy vehicle loads accelerate pavement deterioration.  
Choosing the right base depth, quality stone, and drainage solutions increases longevity.  
We assess traffic loads and weather exposure to design driveways that withstand local conditions.

## Landscaping Integration: Blending Driveway Design with Property
Plantings, retaining walls, and lighting help blend the driveway into the home landscape.  
Soft edges, mulch beds, and native plants reduce runoff and visually enhance the entrance.  
We coordinate landscaping with grading and drainage work to protect plants and prevent erosion.

## Aesthetics and Curb Appeal: How Driveways Affect Home Value
A well-built driveway improves curb appeal and often increases perceived home value.  
Material choice, clean edges, and harmonious color selection all contribute to visual appeal.  
Investing in design and proper construction yields returns through ease of use and buyer interest.

## Contractor Qualifications: How Eger Excavating Ensures Quality Work
Our team holds experience in local codes, permitting, and utility coordination for safe installs.  
We use trained operators, modern equipment, and industry-standard materials on every project.  
References, project photos, and clear estimates help homeowners make confident choices.

## Common Issues: Ruts, Potholes and When to Re-Excavate or Resurface
Ruts and potholes signal a need for regrading, additional base, or improved drainage.  
If problems return after repairs, re-excavation and a deeper base may be required for permanence.  
We evaluate causes and recommend cost-effective repairs or full replacement when necessary.
