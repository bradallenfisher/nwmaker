<p>Crushed stone comes in several sizes and colors to match your landscape and style preferences.<br>We can recommend blends that pack well and produce an attractive texture for your driveway surface.<br>Adding a top binder or larger shoulder stones improves appearance and reduces migration of material.</p>
<h2>Asphalt Concrete Solutions: Paving, Resurfacing and Durability</h2>
<p>Asphalt is an excellent choice for smooth driving surfaces and heavier vehicle traffic.<br>We provide paving, resurfacing, and complete replacements for worn asphalt driveways and lots.<br>Proper base preparation and drainage design are crucial for asphalt longevity and crack prevention.</p>
<h2>Concrete Driveways: Design Options, Strength and Finishes</h2>
<p>Concrete offers low maintenance with many finish and color options for curb appeal.<br>We pour driveways with proper reinforcement, expansion joints, and controlled slopes for drainage.<br>Stamped concrete and broom finishes provide style while maintaining functionality and durability.</p>
<h2>Driveway Design and Paving: Balancing Beauty and Function</h2>
<p>Good design balances accessibility, slope, drainage, and aesthetics for a functional driveway that looks great.<br>We plan widths, turns, and transitions to meet daily use and local code requirements.<br>Landscape integration and edge treatments enhance curb appeal and reduce long-term maintenance.</p>
<h2>Excavation and Site Preparation: Excavation, Grading and Soil Evaluation</h2>
<p>We begin with precise excavation to reach the required depth for base and finish materials.<br>Grading creates the correct slope for water runoff and prevents ponding near foundations.<br>Soil tests determine whether subgrade stabilization or geotextile fabric is necessary for lasting results.</p>
<h2>Grading, Leveling and Compaction Standards for Durable Driveways</h2>
<p>A consistent base grade and <strong>proper compaction</strong> prevent settlement and potholes in the future.<br>We compact in lifts using appropriate equipment to meet industry compaction standards.<br>For gravel driveways, typical compacted base depth ranges from four to six inches, depending on soil and loads.</p>
<h2>Drainage Design to Prevent Ruts, Potholes and Erosion</h2>
<p>Good drainage is the single most important factor for long-lasting driveways and minimal repairs.<br>We design swales, culverts, French drains, and headwalls to control runoff and prevent erosion.<br>Proper drainage reduces maintenance and protects nearby landscaping and structures.</p>
<h2>Curbing and Edge Restraints: Keeping Gravel and Stone in Place</h2>
<p>Edge restraints like concrete curbs, timber, or pavers keep gravel from spreading into the yard.<br>They improve appearance, reduce migration, and extend the life of your stone driveway.<br>We recommend edge restraints on any driveway with regular vehicle traffic or sloped terrain.</p>
<h2>Residential Driveway Installation: What Homeowners Should Expect</h2>
<p>Homeowners can expect a clear timeline, permit coordination when needed, and staged work for minimal disruption.<br>Typical residential projects include excavation, base placement, compaction, surfacing, and final grading.<br>We keep properties tidy and communicate project milestones and any unexpected findings during work.</p>

<h2>Comparing Types of Driveways: Gravel, Concrete, Asphalt and Pavers</h2>
<p>Gravel is cost-effective, permeable, and easy to repair but needs periodic upkeep.<br>Asphalt provides smooth driving surfaces and moderate cost with periodic resurfacing requirements.<br>Concrete lasts long, offers many finishes, and costs more up front than gravel in most cases.</p>
<h2>Cost Considerations and Budgeting for Driveway Projects</h2>
<p>Costs depend on material choice, driveway size, site access, grading needs, and drainage work.<br>Gravel driveway costs typically range from roughly $1.25 to $3.50 per square foot installed.<br>Concrete and asphalt usually cost more up front, but offer different maintenance and lifespan profiles.</p>
<h2>Maintenance and Repair: Pothole Fixes, Resurfacing and Routine Care</h2>
<p>For potholes, remove loose material, level the area, add fresh stone, then compact firmly.<br>Routine maintenance includes adding new surface stone, grading, and maintaining drains in spring and fall.<br>Sealing asphalt and cleaning concrete joints extend pavement life and reduce costly repairs.</p>
<h2>Durability Factors: Weather, Soil, Load and Material Choices</h2>
