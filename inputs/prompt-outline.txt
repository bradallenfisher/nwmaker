Create a detailed content outline for an article about ${keyword}.

Key Information to Consider:
1. Title-Focused Terms: ${titleTermsList}
2. Core Content Terms: ${basicTermsList}
3. Key Entities and their Metrics: ${entitiesList}

The outline should:
- Only contain a title and level 2 headings.
- Be strictly branded for Eger Excavating & Concrete LLC.
- Contain enough headings to use most of the ${titleTermsList}.
- Be formatted using markdown with # for the title, and ## for level 2.
- Never contain bold items, strong items, lists, or other formatting.
- Prioritize covering entities with higher importance and relevance scores.
- Contain headings that strengthen our brand or service.
- End with a call to action section about visting our contact page.
