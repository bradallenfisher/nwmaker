Create a detailed content outline for a blog post about {keyword}.

Key Information to Consider:
1. Title-Focused Terms: {titleTermsList}
2. Core Content Terms: {basicTermsList}
3. Questions from {questions}.
4. Key Entities and their Metrics: {entitiesList}

The outline should:
- Only contain a title and level 2 headings.
- Contain enough headings to use all the {titleTermsList}.
- Create a "FAQ" section using {questions}.
  - Each question should be a level 2 heading.
  - Each question should never contain "FAQ".
- Be formatted using markdown with # for the title, and ## for level 2.
- Never contain bold items, strong items, lists, or other formatting.
- Prioritize covering entities with higher importance and relevance scores.
- Contain headings that strengthen topic.
- End with a conclusion about the {keyword}.
